Nodejs Lesson
=============

Introduction
------------

`Node.js`_: is a server-side technology that based on Google's `V8 JavaScript engine`_.

* It's a highly scalable system that uses asynchronous, event-driven I/O (input/output), rather than threads or separate process.

* It's ideal for web applications that are frequently accessed but computationally simple.

* Programming in node.js is simply like writing Javascript, but with the difference that it will run in the server, instead of running in the Web browser client, as most Javascript code does.


Installation
------------

Installing node.js is very simple in any Debian-based Linux distribution.

Simply type

::

      sudo apt-get install nodejs
